   * Calculate delta of old list and new list.

   * This function implements the algorithm described in "A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files" (Commun. ACM, April 1978, Volume 21, Number 4, Pages 264-268).
   * 
   * Items in the arrays are not compared directly. Instead, a substitute symbol is determined for each item by applying the provided function <code>fnSymbol</code> to it. Items with strictly equal symbols are assumed to represent the same logical item: <pre>
   *     fnSymbol(a) === fnSymbol(b)     <=>     a 'is logically the same as' b
   * </pre> As an additional constraint, casting the symbols to string should not modify the comparison result. If this second constraint is not met, this method might report more diffs than necessary.
   * 
   * If no symbol function is provided, a default implementation is used which applies <code>JSON.stringify</code> to non-string items and reduces the strings to a hash code. It is not guaranteed that this default implementation fulfills the above constraint in all cases, but it is a compromise between implementation effort, generality and performance. If items are known to be non-stringifiable (e.g. because they may contain cyclic references) or when hash collisions are likely, an own <code>fnSymbol</code> function must be provided.
   * 
   * The result of the diff is a sequence of update operations, each consisting of a <code>type</code> (either <code>"insert"</code> or <code>"delete"</code>) and an <code>index</code>. By applying the operations one after the other to the old array, it can be transformed to an array whose items are equal to the new array.
   * 
   * Sample implementation of the update <pre>
   * 
   *    function update(aOldArray, aNewArray) {
   * 
   *        // calculate the diff
   *        var aDiff = jQuery.sap.arraySymbolDiff(aOldArray, aNewArray, __provide_your_symbol_function_here__);

   * 
   *            // invariant: aOldArray and aNewArray now are equal up to (excluding) op.index
   * 
   *            switch ( op.type ) {
   *            case 'insert':
   *                // new array contains a new (or otherwise unmapped) item, add it here
   *                aOldArray.splice(op.index, 0, aNewArray[op.index]);

  /**
   * Creates a string from a pattern by replacing placeholders with concrete values.
   * 
   * The syntax of the pattern is inspired by (but not fully equivalent to) the java.util.MessageFormat.
   * 
   * Placeholders have the form <code>{ integer }</code>, where any occurrence of <code>{0}</code> is replaced by the value with index 0 in <code>aValues</code>, <code>{1}</code> by the value with index 1 in <code>aValues</code> etc.
   * 
   * To avoid interpretation of curly braces as placeholders, any non-placeholder fragment of the pattern can be enclosed in single quotes. The surrounding single quotes will be omitted from the result. Single quotes that are not meant to escape a fragment and that should appear in the result, need to be doubled. In the result, only a single single quote will occur.
   * 
   * Example Pattern Strings: <pre>
   *     jQuery.sap.formatMessage("Say {0}",         ["Hello"]) -> "Say Hello"        // normal use case
   *     jQuery.sap.formatMessage("Say '{0}'",     ["Hello"]) -> "Say {0}"            // escaped placeholder
   *     jQuery.sap.formatMessage("Say ''{0}''", ["Hello"]) -> "Say 'Hello'"    // doubled single quote
   *     jQuery.sap.formatMessage("Say '{0}'''", ["Hello"]) -> "Say {0}'"         // doubled single quote in quoted fragment
   * </pre>
   * 
   * In contrast to java.util.MessageFormat, format types or format styles are not supported. Everything after the argument index and up to the first closing curly brace is ignored. Nested placeholders (as supported by java.lang.MessageFormat for the format type choice) are not ignored but reported as a parse error.
   * 
   * This method throws an Error when the pattern syntax is not fulfilled (e.g. unbalanced curly braces, nested placeholders or a non-numerical argument index).
   * 
   * This method can also be used as a formatter within a binding. The first part of a composite binding will be used as pattern, the following parts as aValues. If there is only one value and this value is an array it will be handled like the default described above.
   * @param {string} sPattern - A pattern string in the described syntax
   * @param {any[]} aValues - The values to be used instead of the placeholders.
   * @returns {string} The formatted result string

   * Returns a JavaScript object which is identified by a sequence of names.

   * A call to <code>getObject("a.b.C")</code> has essentially the same effect as accessing <code>window.a.b.C</code> but with the difference that missing intermediate objects (a or b in the example above) don't lead to an exception.
   * 
   * When the addressed object exists, it is simply returned. If it doesn't exists, the behavior depends on the value of the second, optional parameter <code>iNoCreates</code> (assuming 'n' to be the number of names in the name sequence): <ul> <li>NaN: if iNoCreates is not a number and the addressed object doesn't exist, then <code>getObject()</code> returns <code>undefined</code>. <li>0 &lt; iNoCreates &lt; n: any non-existing intermediate object is created, except the <i>last</i> <code>iNoCreates</code> ones. </ul>
   * 
   * Example: <pre>
   *     getObject()                        -- returns the context object (either param or window)
   *     getObject("a.b.C")         -- will only try to get a.b.C and return undefined if not found.
   *     getObject("a.b.C", 0)    -- will create a, b, and C in that order if they don't exists
   *     getObject("a.b.c", 1)    -- will create a and b, but not C.
   * </pre>
   * 
   * When a <code>oContext</code> is given, the search starts in that object. Otherwise it starts in the <code>window</code> object that this plugin has been created in.
   * 
   * Note: Although this method internally uses <code>object["key"]</code> to address object properties, it does not support all possible characters in a name. Especially the dot ('.') is not supported in the individual name segments, as it is always interpreted as a name separator.
   * @param {string} sName - a dot separated sequence of names that identify the required object

   * 
   * The remainder of the resource name is appended to the URL.
   * 
   * <b>Unified Resource Names</b><br> Several UI5 APIs use <i>Unified Resource Names (URNs)</i> as naming scheme for resources that they deal with (e.h. Javascript, CSS, JSON, XML, ...). URNs are similar to the path component of a URL: <ul> <li>they consist of a non-empty sequence of name segments</li> <li>segments are separated by a forward slash '/'</li> <li>name segments consist of URL path segment characters only. It is recommended to use only ASCII letters (upper or lower case), digits and the special characters '$', '_', '-', '.')</li> <li>the empty name segment is not supported</li> <li>names consisting of dots only, are reserved and must not be used for resources</li> <li>names are case sensitive although the underlying server might be case-insensitive</li> <li>the behavior with regard to URL encoded characters is not specified, %ddd notation should be avoided</li> <li>the meaning of a leading slash is undefined, but might be defined in future. It therefore should be avoided</li> </ul>
   * 
   * UI5 APIs that only deal with Javascript resources, use a slight variation of this scheme, where the extension '.js' is always omitted (see {@link sap.ui.define}, {@link sap.ui.require}).
   * 
   * <b>Relationship to old Module Name Syntax</b><br>
   * 
   * Older UI5 APIs that deal with resources (like {@link jQuery.sap.registerModulePath}, {@link jQuery.sap.require} and {@link jQuery.sap.declare}) used a dot-separated naming scheme (called 'module names') which was motivated by object names in the global namespace in Javascript.
   * 
   * The new URN scheme better matches the names of the corresponding resources (files) as stored in a server and the dot ('.') is no longer a forbidden character in a resource name. This finally allows to handle resources with different types (extensions) with the same API, not only JS files.
   * 
   * Last but not least does the URN scheme better match the naming conventions used by AMD loaders (like <code>requireJS</code>).

   * Sets the bookmark icon for desktop browsers and the icon to be displayed on the home screen of iOS devices after the user does "add to home screen".
   * 
   * Only call this method once and call it early when the page is loading: browsers behave differently when the favicon is modified while the page is alive. Some update the displayed icon inside the browser but use an old icon for bookmarks. When a favicon is given, any other existing favicon in the document will be removed. When at least one home icon is given, all existing home icons will be removed and new home icon tags for all four resolutions will be created.
   * 
   * The home icons must be in PNG format and given in different sizes for iPad/iPhone with and without retina display. The favicon is used in the browser and for desktop shortcuts and should optimally be in ICO format: PNG does not seem to be supported by Internet Explorer and ICO files can contain different image sizes for different usage locations. E.g. a 16x16px version is used inside browsers.
   * 
   * All icons are given in an an object holding icon URLs and other settings. The properties of this object are: <ul> <li>phone: a 60x60 pixel version for non-retina iPhones</li> <li>tablet: a 76x76 pixel version for non-retina iPads</li> <li>phone@2: a 120x120 pixel version for retina iPhones</li> <li>tablet@2: a 152x152 pixel version for retina iPads</li> <li>precomposed: whether the home icons already have some glare effect (otherwise iOS will add it) (default: false)</li> <li>favicon: the ICO file to be used inside the browser and for desktop shortcuts</li> </ul>
   * 
   * One example is: <pre>
   * {
   *        'phone':'phone-icon_60x60.png',
   *        'phone@2':'phone-retina_120x120.png',

   *        'precomposed':true,
   *        'favicon':'desktop.ico'
   * }
   * </pre> If one of the sizes is not given, the largest available alternative image will be used instead for this size. On Android these icons may or may not be used by the device. Apparently chances can be improved by using icons with glare effect, so the "precomposed" property can be set to "true". Some Android devices may also use the favicon for bookmarks instead of the home icons.</li>

/**
 * A Logging API for JavaScript.
 * 
 * Provides methods to manage a client-side log and to create entries in it. Each of the logging methods {@link jQuery.sap.log.debug}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.info}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.warning}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.error} and {@link jQuery.sap.log.fatal} creates and records a log entry, containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will be one of {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.
 * 
 * By using the {@link jQuery.sap.log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level.ERROR}. For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level.DEBUG}.
 * 
 * All logging methods allow to specify a <b>component</b>. These components are simple strings and don't have a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for such a component. With <code>{@link jQuery.sap.log.getLogger}(sComponent)</code>, one can retrieve a logger that automatically adds the given <code>sComponent</code> as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified. Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link jQuery.sap.log.Logger#setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine granular control about the created logging entries. {@link jQuery.sap.log.Logger#getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective log level for a given component.
 * 
 * {@link jQuery.sap.log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.
 * 
 * Furthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending it to some external target (server).

/**
 * A Storage API for JavaScript.

 * Provides methods to store data on the client using Web Storage API support by the browser. The data received by this API must be already serialized, in string format. Similarly, the API returns the retrieved data in serialized string format, so it is the responsibility of the caller to de-serialize it, if applicable.
 * 
 * Attention: The Web Storage API stores the data on the client. Therefore do not use this API for confidential information.
 * 
 * One can get access to the 'default' storage by using {@link jQuery.sap.storage} directly or alternatively via factory functionality available as <code>jQuery.sap.storage(jQuery.sap.storage.Type.session)</code> returning an object implementing this interface.
 * 
 * A typical intended usage of this API is the storage of a string representing the state of a control. In such usage, the data is stored in the browser session, and the methods to be used are {@link #put} and {@link #get}. The method {@link #remove} can be used to delete the previously saved state.
 * 
 * In sake of completeness, the method {@link #clear} is available. However, it should be called only in very particular situations, when a global erasing of data is required. If only keys with certain prefix should be deleted the method {@link #removeAll} should be used.

First, if the locale contains a region information (fr_FR), then the locale without the region is tried (fr).
