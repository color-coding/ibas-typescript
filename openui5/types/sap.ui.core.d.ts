     * <p>Defines a JavaScript module with its ID, its dependencies and a module export value or factory.</p><p>The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.loader.config" data-sap-ui-target="config">configuration</a>. The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level <code>sap.ui.define</code> call.</p><p>If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was given as <code>vFactory</code>, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).</p><p><i>Example:</i><br> The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js', it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'. <pre>
      sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {
    
        // create a new class
        var SomeClass = function() {};
    
        // add methods to its prototype
        SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {
    
            // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )
            var mSettings = Helper.foo();
    
            // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')
            return new Bar(mSettings);
    
        }
    
        // return the class as module value
        return SomeClass;
    
      });
    </pre></p><p>In another module or in an application HTML page, the <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.require" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.require">sap.ui.require</a> API can be used to load the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:</p><p><pre>
    sap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {
    
      // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it
      new Something().foo();
    
    });
    </pre></p><h3>Module Name Syntax</h3><p><code>sap.ui.define</code> uses a simplified variant of the <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/jQuery.sap.getResourcePath" data-sap-ui-target="getResourcePath">unified resource name</a> syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax is, that for <code>sap.ui.define</code> and <code>sap.ui.require</code>, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.</p><p>As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).</p><p>It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.</p><h3>Dependency to Modules</h3><p>If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies array.</p><p><b>Note:</b> The order in which the dependency modules are <i>executed</i> is <b>not</b> defined by the order in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies <i>between</i> the dependency modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution order (other than expressed by their dependencies).</p><p><b>Note:</b> A static module export (a literal provided to <code>sap.ui.define</code>) cannot depend on the module exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function, potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.</p><h3>Asynchronous Contract</h3><p><code>sap.ui.define</code> is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific test scenario.</p><p>For example, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must not use the module export value immediately after invoking <code>sap.ui.define</code>:</p><p><pre>
      // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
    
      // define a class Something as AMD module
      sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
        var Something = function() {};
        return Something;
      });
    
      // DON'T DO THAT!
      // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
      new Something();
    
    </pre></p><p>Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/jQuery.sap.declare" data-sap-ui-target="declare">jQuery.sap.declare</a> and <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/jQuery.sap/methods/jQuery.sap.require" data-sap-ui-target="jQuery.sap.require">jQuery.sap.require</a>.</p><h3>(No) Global References</h3><p>To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with <code>sap.ui.define</code> should not make any use of global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.</p><p>As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel to the old global names. The fourth parameter of <code>sap.ui.define</code> has been added to support that transition phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features</p><p><ol> <li>Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current module is ensured</li> <li>The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under the global name which is derived from the ID of the module</li> </ol></p><p>The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.</p><h3>Third Party Modules</h3><p> Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies in a <code>sap.ui.define</code> call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports available, so called <em>shims</em> have to be defined.</p><p>Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.</p><p>For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace <code>sap/ui/thirdparty/</code>), the necessary shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module <code>ui5loader-autoconfig.js</code> during bootstrap.</p><p>Example: <pre>
      // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
      // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
      // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
      // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
      sap.ui.loader.config({
        shim: {
          'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
             amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
             exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
          }
        }
      });
    
      // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
      sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
    
        new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
    
        ...
      });
    </pre></p><h3>Differences to Standard AMD</h3><p>The current implementation of <code>sap.ui.define</code> differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) or from concrete AMD loaders like <code>requireJS</code> in several aspects: <ul> <li>The name <code>sap.ui.define</code> is different from the plain <code>define</code>. This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs like <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/jQuery.sap/methods/jQuery.sap.require" data-sap-ui-target="jQuery.sap.require">jQuery.sap.require</a>.</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not planned to support this in future</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does <b>not</b> support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations using <code>sap.ui.require("something")</code> are automagically converted into <code>sap.ui.define</code> dependencies before executing the factory function.</li> </ul></p><h3>Limitations, Design Considerations</h3><p> <ul> <li><b>Limitation</b>: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously, this only works as long as <code>sap.ui.define</code> uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous loading is implemented.</li> <li>It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync <code>jQuery.sap.require</code> call can load a <code>sap.ui.define</code>'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously, the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)</li> <li>A single file must not contain multiple calls to <code>sap.ui.define</code>. Multiple calls currently are only supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract</li> </ul></p>

       * <p>Base Class that introduces some basic concepts like state management or databinding.</p><p>New subclasses of ManagedObject are created with a call to <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" data-sap-ui-target="undefined">ManagedObject.extend</a> and can make use of the following managed features:</p><h3>Properties</h3><p> Managed properties represent the state of a ManagedObject. They can store a single value of a simple data type (like 'string' or 'int'). They have a <i>name</i> (e.g. 'size') and methods to get the current value (<code>getSize</code>), or to set a new value (<code>setSize</code>). When a property is modified, the ManagedObject is marked as invalidated. A managed property can be bound against a property in a <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.model.Model" data-sap-ui-target="Model">sap.ui.model.Model</a> by using the <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/bindProperty" data-sap-ui-target="bindProperty">#bindProperty</a> method. Updates to the model property will be automatically reflected in the managed property and - if TwoWay databinding is active, changes to the managed property will be reflected in the model. An existing binding can be removed by calling <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/unbindProperty" data-sap-ui-target="unbindProperty">#unbindProperty</a>.</p><p>If a ManagedObject is cloned, the clone will have the same values for its managed properties as the source of the clone - if the property wasn't bound. If it is bound, the property in the clone will be bound to the same model property as in the source.</p><p>Details about the declaration of a managed property, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.base.ManagedObject">extend </a> method.</p><h3>Aggregations</h3><p> Managed aggregations can store one or more references to other ManagedObjects. They are a mean to control the lifecycle of the aggregated objects: one ManagedObject can be aggregated by at most one parent ManagedObject at any time. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, all aggregated objects are destroyed as well and the object itself is removed from its parent. That is, aggregations won't contain destroyed objects or null/undefined.</p><p>Aggregations have a <i>name</i> ('e.g 'header' or 'items'), a <i>cardinality</i> ('0..1' or '0..n') and are of a specific <i>type</i> (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the aggregated object for a specific aggregation of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. <code>setHeader</code>, <code>getHeader</code> for an aggregation named 'header'). For an aggregation of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all aggregated objects (<code>getItems</code>), to locate an object in the aggregation (e.g. <code>indexOfItem</code>), to add, insert or remove a single aggregated object (<code>addItem</code>, <code>insertItem</code>, <code>removeItem</code>) or to remove or destroy all objects from an aggregation (<code>removeAllItems</code>, <code>destroyItems</code>).</p><p>Details about the declaration of a managed aggregation, the metadata that describes the aggregation, and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.base.ManagedObject">extend</a> method.</p><p>Aggregations of cardinality 0..n can be bound to a collection in a model by using <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/bindAggregation" data-sap-ui-target="bindAggregation">#bindAggregation</a> (and unbound again using <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/unbindAggregation" data-sap-ui-target="unbindAggregation">#unbindAggregation</a>). For each context in the model collection, a corresponding object will be created in the managed aggregation, either by cloning a template object or by calling a factory function.</p><p>Aggregations also control the databinding context of bound objects: by default, aggregated objects inherit all models and binding contexts from their parent object.</p><p>When a ManagedObject is cloned, all aggregated objects will be cloned as well - but only if they haven't been added by databinding. In that case, the aggregation in the clone will be bound to the same model collection.</p><h3>Associations</h3><p> Managed associations also form a relationship between objects, but they don't define a lifecycle for the associated objects. They even can 'break' in the sense that an associated object might have been destroyed already although it is still referenced in an association. For the same reason, the internal storage for associations are not direct object references but only the IDs of the associated target objects.</p><p>Associations have a <i>name</i> ('e.g 'initialFocus'), a <i>cardinality</i> ('0..1' or '0..n') and are of a specific <i>type</i> (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the associated object for a specific association of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. <code>setInitialFocus</code>, <code>getInitialFocus</code>). For an association of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all associated objects (<code>getRefItems</code>), to add, insert or remove a single associated object (<code>addRefItem</code>, <code>insertRefItem</code>, <code>removeRefItem</code>) or to remove all objects from an association (<code>removeAllRefItems</code>).</p><p>Details about the declaration of a managed association, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.base.ManagedObject">extend</a> method.</p><p>Associations can't be bound to the model.</p><p>When a ManagedObject is cloned, the result for an association depends on the relationship between the associated target object and the root of the clone operation. If the associated object is part of the to-be-cloned object tree (reachable via aggregations from the root of the clone operation), then the cloned association will reference the clone of the associated object. Otherwise the association will reference the same object as in the original tree. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, other objects that are only associated, are not affected by the destroy operation.</p><h3>Events</h3><p> Managed events provide a mean for communicating important state changes to an arbitrary number of 'interested' listeners. Events have a <i>name</i> and (optionally) a set of <i>parameters</i>. For each event there will be methods to add or remove an event listener as well as a method to fire the event. (e.g. <code>attachChange</code>, <code>detachChange</code>, <code>fireChange</code> for an event named 'change').</p><p>Details about the declaration of managed events, the metadata that describes the event, and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.base.ManagedObject">extend</a> method.</p><p>When a ManagedObject is cloned, all listeners registered for any event in the clone source are also registered to the clone. Later changes are not reflected in any direction (neither from source to clone, nor vice versa).</p><p><a name="lowlevelapi"></p><h3>Low Level APIs:</h3><p></a> The prototype of ManagedObject provides several generic, low level APIs to manage properties, aggregations, associations, and events. These generic methods are solely intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single managed property etc. (e.g. a function <code>setSize(value)</code> that sets a new value for property 'size'). <a class="jsdoclink" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.base.ManagedObject">sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend</a> creates default implementations of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation of a subclass then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation, e.g. to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is therefore important to understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed object, as that would bypass the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.</p>

        <img src="./resources/sap/ui/documentation/sdk/images/link-external.png" 
        title="Information published on non SAP site" class="sapUISDKExternalLink"/>). To be on the safe side, productive applications should always require any modules that they directly depend on.</li></p><p><li>With the <code>noLibraryCSS</code> property, the library can be marked as 'theming-free'. Otherwise, the framework will add a &lt;link&gt; tag to the page's head, pointing to the library's theme-specific stylesheet. The creation of such a &lt;link&gt; tag can be suppressed with the <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration" data-sap-ui-target="Configuration">global configuration option</a> <code>preloadLibCss</code>. It can contain a list of library names for which no stylesheet should be included. This is e.g. useful when an application merges the CSS for multiple libraries and already loaded the resulting stylesheet.</li></p><p><li>If a list of library <code>dependencies</code> is specified in the info object, those libraries will be loaded synchronously by <code>initLibrary</code>.<br> <b>Note:</b> Dependencies between libraries don't have to be modeled as AMD dependencies. Only when enums or types from an additional library are used in the coding of the <code>library.js</code> module, the library should be additionally listed in the AMD dependencies.</li> </ul></p><p>Last but not least, higher layer frameworks might want to include their own metadata for libraries. The property <code>extensions</code> might contain such additional metadata. Its structure is not defined by the framework, but it is strongly suggested that each extension only occupies a single property in the <code>extensions</code> object and that the name of that property contains some namespace information (e.g. library name that introduces the feature) to avoid conflicts with other extensions. The framework won't touch the content of <code>extensions</code> but will make it available in the library info objects returned by <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.core.Core/methods/getLoadedLibraries" data-sap-ui-target="getLoadedLibraries">#getLoadedLibraries</a>.</p><h3>Relationship to Descriptor for Libraries (manifest.json)</h3><p>The information contained in <code>oLibInfo</code> is partially redundant to the content of the descriptor for the same library (its <code>manifest.json</code> file).

Library developers therefore should keep the information in both files in sync.</p><p>When the <code>manifest.json</code> is generated from the <code>.library</code> file (which is the default for UI5 libraries built with Maven), then the content of the <code>.library</code> and <code>library.js</code> files must be kept in sync.</p>

But in some cases it makes sense that a control only renders a subset of its children based on some criterion. For example, a typical carousel control might, for performance reasons, only render the currently visible children (and maybe some child before and after the visible area to facilitate slide-in / slide-out animations), but not all children. This leads to situations where a child had been rendered before, but shouldn't be rendered anymore after an update of the carousel's position. The DOM related state of that child then must be cleaned up correctly, e.g. by de-registering resize handlers or native event handlers. <code>cleanupControlWithoutRendering</code> helps with that task by triggering the same activities that the normal rendering triggers before the rendering of a control (e.g. it fire the <code>BeforeRendering</code> event). It just doesn't call the renderer and the control will not receive an <code>AfterRendering</code> event.</p><p>The following example shows how <code>renderControl</code> and <code>cleanupControlWithoutRendering</code> should be used:</p><p><pre>
          CarouselRenderer.render = function(rm, oCarousel){
        
            ...
        
            oCarousel.getPages().forEach( oPage ) {
               if ( oCarousel.isPageToBeRendered( oPage ) ) {
                  rm.renderControl( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering, render, later onAfterRendering
               } else {
                  rm.cleanupControlWithoutRendering( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering
               }

            ...
        
          };
        </pre></p><h3>DOM Removal</h3><p> The method does not remove the DOM of the given control. The caller of this method has to take care to remove it at some later point in time. It should indeed be <i>later</i>, not <i>before</i> as the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> hook of the control might need access to the old DOM for a proper cleanup.</p><p>For parents which are rendered with the normal mechanism as shown in the example above, the removal of the old child DOM is guaranteed. The whole DOM of the parent control (including the DOM of the no longer rendered child) will be replaced with new DOM (no longer containing the child) when the rendering cycle finishes.</p><p><b>Note:</b>: the functionality of this method is different from the default handling for invisible controls (controls with <code>visible == false</code>). The standard rendering for invisible controls still renders a placeholder DOM. This allows re-rendering of the invisible control once it becomes visible again without a need to render its parent, too. Children that are cleaned up with this method here, are supposed to have no more DOM at all. Rendering them later on therefore requires an involvement (typically: a rendering) of their parent.</p>

It is possible to navigate between the items via the arrow keys. If needed, paging using the Page Up and Page Down keys is possible. (To activate call <code>setPageSize</code> with a value &gt; 0.) HOME and END keys are also supported. Focusing an item via mouse also is also supported. For mouse navigation, the <code>mousedown</code> event is used.</p><p>As the <code>ItemNavigation</code> works with DOM nodes, the items and the control area must be provided as DOM references. There is one root DOM reference (set via <code>setRootDomRef</code>). All item DOM references (set via <code>setItemDomRefs</code>) must be places somewhere inside of this root DOM reference. Only focusable items are used for the navigation, meaning disabled items or separator items are just ignored by navigating through the items. In some cases however, it makes sense to put the non-focusable items in the array of the DOM references to keep the indexes stable or like in the calling control. <b>Hint:</b> To make a DOM reference focusable a <code>tabindex</code> of -1 can be set.</p><p><b>Note</b> After re-rendering of the control or changing the DOM nodes of the control, the DOM references of the <code>ItemNavigation</code> must be updated. Then the same item (corresponding to the index) will get the focus.</p><p>The <code>ItemNavigation</code> adjusts the <code>tabindex</code> of all DOM references relating to the current focused item. So if the control containing the items gets the focus (e.g. via tab navigation), it is always the focused items which will be focused.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If the <code>ItemNavigation</code> is nested in another <code>ItemNavigation</code> (e.g. <code>SegmentedButton</code> in <code>Toolbar</code>), the <code>RootDomRef</code> will always have <code>tabindex</code> -1.</p><p>Per default the <code>ItemNavigation</code> cycles over the items. It navigates again to the first item if the Arrow Down or Arrow Right key is pressed while the last item has the focus. It navigates to the last item if arrow up or arrow left is pressed while the first item has the focus. If you want to stop the navigation at the first and last item, call the <code>setCycling</code> method with a value of <code>false</code>.</p><p>It is possible to have multiple columns in the item navigation. If multiple columns are used, the keyboard navigation changes. The Arrow Right and Arrow Left keys will take the user to the next or previous item, and the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys will navigate the same way but in a vertical direction.</p><p>The <code>ItemNavigation</code> also allows setting a selected index that is used to identify the selected item.

           * <p>Context interface provided by XML template processing as an additional first argument to any formatter function which opts in to this mechanism. Candidates for such formatter functions are all those used in binding expressions which are evaluated during XML template processing, including those used inside template instructions like <code>&lt;template:if></code>. The formatter function needs to be marked with a property <code>requiresIContext = true</code> to express that it requires this extended signature (compared to ordinary formatter functions). The usual arguments are provided after the first one (currently: the raw value from the model).</p><p>This interface provides callback functions to access the model and path which are needed to process OData V4 annotations. It initially offers a subset of methods from <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.model.Context" data-sap-ui-target="Context">sap.ui.model.Context</a> so that formatters might also be called with a context object for convenience, e.g. outside of XML template processing (see below for an exception to this rule).</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose you have a formatter function called "foo" like below and it is used within an XML template like <code>&lt;template:if test="{path: '...', formatter: 'foo'}"></code>. In this case <code>foo</code> is called with arguments <code>oInterface, vRawValue</code> such that <code>oInterface.getModel().getObject(oInterface.getPath()) === vRawValue</code> holds. <pre>
          window.foo = function (oInterface, vRawValue) {
              //TODO ...
          };
          window.foo.requiresIContext = true;
          </pre></p><p><b>Composite Binding Examples:</b> Suppose you have the same formatter function and it is used in a composite binding like <code>&lt;Text text="{path: 'Label', formatter: 'foo'}: {path: 'Value', formatter: 'foo'}"/></code>. In this case <code>oInterface.getPath()</code> refers to ".../Label" in the 1st call and ".../Value" in the 2nd call. This means each formatter call knows which part of the composite binding it belongs to and behaves just as if it was an ordinary binding.</p><p>Suppose your formatter is not used within a part of the composite binding, but at the root of the composite binding in order to aggregate all parts like <code> &lt;Text text="{parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}], formatter: 'foo'}"/></code>. In this case <code>oInterface.getPath(0)</code> refers to ".../Label" and <code>oInterface.getPath(1)</code> refers to ".../Value". This means, the root formatter can access the ith part of the composite binding at will (since 1.31.0); see also <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.core.util.XMLPreprocessor.IContext/methods/sap.ui.core.util.XMLPreprocessor.IContext.getInterface" data-sap-ui-target="undefined">getInterface</a>. The function <code>foo</code> is called with arguments such that <code> oInterface.getModel(i).getObject(oInterface.getPath(i)) === arguments[i + 1]</code> holds. This use is not supported within an expression binding, that is, <code>&lt;Text text="{= ${parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}], formatter: 'foo'} }"/></code> does not work as expected because the property <code>requiresIContext = true</code> is ignored.</p><p>To distinguish those two use cases, just check whether <code>oInterface.getModel() === undefined</code>, in which case the formatter is called on root level of a composite binding. To find out the number of parts, probe for the smallest non-negative integer where <code>oInterface.getModel(i) === undefined</code>. This additional functionality is, of course, not available from <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.model.Context" data-sap-ui-target="Context">sap.ui.model.Context</a>, i.e. such formatters MUST be called with an instance of this context interface.</p>

So, <code>/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/16</code> can be the path to the entity type with name "Order" in the schema with namespace "MySchema". However, these paths are not stable: If an entity type with lower index is removed from the schema, the path to <code>Order</code> changes to <code>/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/15</code>.</p><p>To avoid problems with changing indexes, <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.model.Model/methods/getObject" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.model.Model/methods/getObject">getObject</a> and <a class="jsdoclink scrollToMethod" target="_self" href="#/api/sap.ui.model.Model/methods/getProperty" data-sap-ui-target="sap.ui.model.Model/methods/getProperty">getProperty</a> support XPath-like queries for the indexes (since 1.29.1).
